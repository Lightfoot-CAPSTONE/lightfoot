# lightfoot

<b> What is a lightfoot? <b>
A "lightfoot" is a single Cyborg.
They are programmed to arrive at an endpoint quickly and intact.
Each lightfoot is equiped with a "pulmo" which contains appx. 1500 miles of airway.
In order for a lightfoot to reach its destination intact, it must avoid "pulmo threat- areas" or "P.T.A.'s"

When more than one are gathered, they are referred to as "Lightfeet".
Groups of Lightfeet form to become "Lightfleets"

A PTA is dynamic.  
So must be a lightfoot.

The question isn't "can you help a lightfoot?"
The question is will you.  And if so... How?

Protect the Lightfleet.  


* lightfoot is a full-stack web application built with Mapbox GL JS which makes it possible to change the map's style and the data it displays dynamically and in response to user interaction.  (selected to take advantage of a lightfoots augmented vision capabilities)
